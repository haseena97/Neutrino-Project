# Neutrino Thermal Process Analysis Project
# Create neutrino Hertzprung-Russell diagram and Kippenhahn diagram from experimental data 
## General info

## Analysis steps
* Raw data needs some processing to be useful in the public code
* Clean data are added into public code to calculate all thermal processes by neutrino from 5 different masses of stars
* All thermal processes are then plotted using Python
## Project status
* Project is ongoing
## Public code reference 
* Itoh et.al
